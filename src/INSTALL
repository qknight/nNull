please see lastlog.de for updates. i will upload this software at github.com at 
  http://github.com/qknight/nNull

== installation ==
0. prepare the nNull-server dbus daemon
  (first let's resolve a dbus::systembus permission problem)
  cp nNULL.conf /etc/dbus-1/system.d/
  /etc/init.d/dbus restart

  the nNull-server looks for configs in /root/config/ so
  mkdir -p /root/config (as root)
  cp test.N0 /root/config
  chmod 0755 /root/config/test.N0
  - you can also adapt test.N0 to your needs and rename it to wpa_default-ath0.N0
1. nNull-server:
  cd server
  qmake
  make
  see debug/ for the binary called nNull-server
  ./nNull-server (should be run as root, not as normal user)
  you can also start it via init (which i don't do) or you can use /etc/conf.d/local.start (as i do)
2. client:
  cd client
  qmake
  make
  see debug/ for the binary called nNull-client
  ./client (should be run as normal user not as root)

in case the client can't access the nNull-server daemon, use qdbusviewer to see if the service is there

== usage ==
i adapted the dhcp script in /etc/dhcp/ to use this:
                                "00001009")
                                        exec qdbus --system de.lastlog.nmInterface /MainApplication executeConfiguration wpa_supplicant_generic_dhcp_ath0.N0
                                        #exec /root/config/wpa_supplicant_generic_dhcp_ath0 &
                                        #
                                        ;;
                                "0000100a")
                                        exec qdbus --system de.lastlog.nmInterface /MainApplication executeConfiguration /root/config/internetlab-ath0
                                        #exec /root/config/internetlab-ath0 &
                                        #
                                        ;;
this way my graphical interface will reflect the status change in the logs (when it's running)

on boot i do run also a qdbus call from here:
  /etc/conf.d/local.start

== how does executing a script look like? ==
the server instance listens on the dbus::systembus and one can use qdbus to load a certain config. the config is then loaded and debug output
is sent to the attached client via dbus as well.

the client has a trayIcon which can be clicked with left mouse button - LMB to view the debug widget
MMB will clear the debug widget's content

have fun
