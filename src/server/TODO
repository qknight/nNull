issue:
 currently we are logging only the main script which executes other programs whose behaviour is
 to detache from the console. it would be nice to let these processes log into /root/config/logs/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/
 which is created on the fly before script execution.

 for example wpa_supplicant:
 /root/config/logs/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/wpa_supplicant.stdout
 /root/config/logs/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/wpa_supplicant.stderr

solution:
 use QFileSystemWatch on /root/config/logs/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/wpa_supplicant.stderr on changes
