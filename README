one point why linux suckz is the fact that network managing is 'command line' based. there are
no gui frontends which i consider worth using. 
for instance 'networkmanager' has a good basic design but fails when something does not work as expected. th
ere is really no good way to debug the network using networkmanager. 

here i put some ideas together how to make things better. in general i love the dbus design of networkmanager.
