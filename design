this is a list of general ideas (not implemented in nNull yet):

         system daemon --------------------- mvc (via dbus) --------------------- gui backend
       (what happens in the network)                                            (written in qt)
             |
             |- abstraction over wlan
             |  \- not encrypted and encrypted
             |- normal network
             |- vpn

 - enables excessive logging of events (disconnects as in wpa or power levels on wlan)
 - plugin interface for monitoring plugins as kde 3.x plugins for wlan had already
 - contains a pyramid of events as:
    - wlan status -> if connected proceed
    - if connected -> dhcp or static address
    - if address set -> done or vpn
    - if vpn -> connect 
    ...


- openresolv
- dnsmasq
- wpa_supplicant (wpa_cli?)
- ip/iwconfig
- dhclient
- dhcpcd
